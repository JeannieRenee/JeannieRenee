<br>
🧩  I'm naturally curious, analytical, strategic, and quick to recognize patterns.
<br>
👯‍♀️  I write code with scalability and accessibility in mind, with a passion for building well-designed and intuitive user interfaces. 
<br>
🌻  You can find me reading, riding my bike, discovering new comic/game/book shops, or just lounging outside with my aussie, Gilly. 
<br>
🤠  Ask me about the time I won Best Actress at a film festival for my role in an indie western film.
