🧩 I'm curious, analytical and strategic by nature, and quick to recognize patterns. 
<br>
👯‍♀️ I enjoy writing code with scalability and accessibility in mind, with a passion for building well-designed and intuitive user interfaces. 
<br>
🌻 You can find me reading, riding my bike, discovering new comic/game/book shops or just lounging outside with my Australian Shepherd, Gilly. 
<br>
🤠 Ask me about the time I won Best Actress at a film festival for my role in an indie western film.
