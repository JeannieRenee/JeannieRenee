# 💫 About Me:
Software + Web Developer | Problem Solving Wizard | Puzzle Queen
<br>
<br>
🧩 Curious, analytical and strategic by nature. 
<br>
👯‍♀️ I love refactoring code with scalability and accessibility in mind. 
<br>
🌻 You can find me reading, riding my bike, discovering new comic/game/book shops or just lounging outside with my Australian Shepherd, Gilly. 
<br>
🤠 Ask me about the time I won Best Actress at a film festival for my role in an indie western film.
